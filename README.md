# Hi, my name is Davis Rodriguez 👋

I’m a Computer Science student @ UMBC and a full-stack developer with an interest for educational technology. By the end of my career, it is my mission to have helped bridge the gaps between education and accessibility. Since I was young, technology has always been a vested interest of mine. Ive coded since elementary, joined robotics in middleschool, and pursued advanced collegiate coursework as soon as quarantine ended. 

I hope to work with likeminded inviduals who have a similar vision to me. I like to look forward at what *could* be instead of *what is*.
